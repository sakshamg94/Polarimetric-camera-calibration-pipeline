For the function generator, just use the manual instructions [here](http://web.mit.edu/8.13/8.13d/manuals/bnc-555-digital-delay-generator.pdf)

1. Acquire images using the `matlab_func_generator.m` file. Saving the images from `data1`, `data2`, `data3` streams into different folders. Use this destination folder naming convention: `cam_i` for i in {1,2,3} for checkerboard images, `cam_i_Analyzer_Matrix` for images for the Analyzer Matrix evaluation using the Lazy Susan, `cam_i_expt` for actual experimental system images, `cam_i_flat` for flat field images by shining iPhone light through white paper, `cam_i_dark` for dark field images obtained by covering the camera lens.
2. 

## To DO: 
List the 
1. Calibration pipeline and file usage & what parameters are stored by which file

2. Listthe file usage for correcting the experimental images

3. How is intensity apped to Stokes params (list file usage)
